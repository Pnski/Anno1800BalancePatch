# Patch-Notes for Version 0.0.1
## Palace
- Maximum prestige level 25 -> 10
- but maximum of 50%
- Department of Administration = Workforce ~~300~~ -> 150
- Department of Labour = Trade Union Buff ~~60%~~ -> 30%
- Department of Culture = Specialist Buff ~~120%~~ -> 60%
- Department of Labour = Harbourmaster Storage ~~1200~~ -> 600

I didn't change the Department of Welfare since i do not see the reason, it wouldnt increase any difficulty and would just make planning more annoying.

## Zoo
### Cordillera
- ~~Farmer Residence, Jornalero Residence, and Hacienda Jornalero Quarters~~ -> Residences
## Docklands
