# Patch-Notes for Version 0.0.1
## Palace
- Maximum prestige level 25 -> 10
- but maximum of 50%
- Department of Administration = Workforce ~~300~~ -> 150
- Department of Labour = Trade Union Buff ~~60%~~ -> 30%
- Department of Culture = Specialist Buff ~~120%~~ -> 60%
- Department of Labour = Harbourmaster Storage ~~1200~~ -> 600

I didn't change the Department of Welfare since i do not see the reason, it wouldnt increase any difficulty and would just make planning more annoying.
## Research
- Institute usable ~~10'000~~ -> 100'000 Engineers
## Zoo
### Cordillera
- ~~Farmer Residence, Jornalero Residence, and Hacienda Jornalero Quarters~~ -> Residences
### Domestic Animals
### Eastern Jungle
### Enbesean Highlands
### Great Coral Reef
### Great Desert
### Luminaries
### Miambo Woodlands
### Ocean Predetors
### Proud Savannah
### Rainforest
~~Effect: +30 Attractiveness from all Trade Unions.~~ -> Effect: +10 Influence from Town Halls & Trade Unions
With the change for the maximum prestige bonuses the need to raise the attractiveness is reduced, while still maintaining the influence need. So i decided to move the influencereduction to a 6 piece set and the attractiveness to a 3 piece set.
